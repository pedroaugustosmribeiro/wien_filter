Velocity Selector Simulator
===========================

Short run instructions:
------------------------

Change to src directory, if not already there. Run the program, specifying the proper parameters:

./wien_filter dt Bx Ez

Parameters (real numbers, accepts cientific notation, eg 1e-10):

	dt: time-step interval (in seconds)

	Bx: x-axis component of magnetic field (in Tesla). 
	    The other two components are set to 0 inside the code

	Ez: z-axis component of electric field (in V/m).
	    The other two components are set to 0 inside the code

Input data:
------------

Located at the run directory, the data to be processed must be inside a plain text
file named "input.dat". An example "input.dat" is already included.

Output dat:
------------

Located at the run directory, the processed data will appear in a plain text file
named "output.dat" after the execution of the program.


--------------------------------------------------------------------------
				Important:
--------------------------------------------------------------------------

The compiled program must be run inside the directory src, with the terminal pointing to it.
If you move the file "wien_filter" to another place, or run it from another folder,
it fail with an "Can't read inputfile" error.


Input data structure:
----------------------

line
1	number of particles to simulate
2	n vx vy vz m q
.
.

Where:
	n: particle number, integer only. Start at 1,2,...
	   (just to diferentiate between diferent particles)
	vx vy vz: components x,y and z of initial velocity of particle n (in m/s)
	      	  ,real.
	m: mass of particle n (in units of electron mass), real. Shall be positive.
	q: charge of particle n (in units of absolute value of electron charge)
	   ,real. Especify a signed value.

Example:
One electron with initial velocity V= 10j m/s.

1
1 0 10 0 1 -1

Output data structure:
-----------------------

Basically the same as the input data, but with the number of particles that passed
through the configured filter written on the last line, preceded by the non-filtered
 particles information.
